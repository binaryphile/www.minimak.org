Githubber Dave Baker ("fullybaked") was kind enough to contribute OSX
bindings.  They are now included at [the repository] as well as in the
[download zip] in the "osx" folder.

He also has a [fork of the Minimak project] on github.  Since I don't have
a Mac, if there are any contributions you'd like to make on the Mac, I'd
suggest coordinating with him.

Minimak for Mac...hmm, Minimac?  I think I hear Apple's legal team
sharpening their pens... :)
